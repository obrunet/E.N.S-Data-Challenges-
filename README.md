# E.N.S Data Challenges

#### [Historical consumption regression for electricity supply pricing](https://github.com/obrunet/E.N.S_Data_Challenges/blob/master/Historical-consumption-regression-for-electricity-supply-pricing-master/README.md) - [Official Page](https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/12) - [Summary](https://github.com/obrunet/E.N.S_Data_Challenges/blob/master/Historical-consumption-regression-for-electricity-supply-pricing-master/project/Challenge%20data.pdf)
* Use case: predict the electricity consumption of 2 given sites during the next year
* Data: consumption of 3 other sites, weather (temperature, humidity), and time infos during a year.
* Concepts: supervised ML regression of __time series__, deep learning models __R.N.N / G.R.U__.
